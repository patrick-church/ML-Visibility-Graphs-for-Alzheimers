# ML-Visibility-Graphs-for-Alzheimers
Code for analysis, feature selection, and classification of Alzheimer's patient data (and prodromal Alzheimer's) for the paper: [https://www.mdpi.com/2282770](https://www.mdpi.com/2282770).

To get started: You need to install the python3 packages in `requirements.txt`. Everything is self contained in the Jupyter notebook, other than the data. If you have the data, just put the the notebook in the same directory as the folders containing the data (eg "AD_data", "MCI All New Raw Data", etc.) and run it sequentially.


Data availability: The datasets presented in this paper are not readily available because they may contain identifying information and are used with permissions from the Alzheimer’s Disease Research Centers at the University of California, San Diego and the University of California, Davis. Requests to access the datasets should be directed to John Olichney, M.D: [jmolichney@ucdavis.edu]
